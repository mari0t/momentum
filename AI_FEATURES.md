# AI Features in Momentum App

## Overview
The Momentum app now includes several AI-powered features that provide intelligent insights, personalized recommendations, and real-time productivity coaching.

## ðŸ§  AI Service (`src/services/aiService.js`)

### Core Functions

#### 1. Data Analysis
- **`analyzeUserData(userData)`**: Analyzes user's tasks, health, focus sessions, and streaks
- **`calculateProductivityScore()`**: Generates a 0-100 productivity score based on multiple factors
- **`getInsightsSummary()`**: Provides overview of all AI insights and recommendations

#### 2. Smart Insights
The AI analyzes:
- **Task Completion Rate**: Warns if below 50%, celebrates if above 80%
- **Focus Sessions**: Suggests improvements for short sessions or limited focus time
- **Health Metrics**: Alerts for poor sleep quality or low calorie intake
- **Streak Analysis**: Motivates based on current streak length

#### 3. Personalized Recommendations
- **Time-based**: Different advice for morning, afternoon, and evening
- **Context-aware**: Suggestions based on current task load and focus status
- **Actionable**: Specific tips like "2-minute rule" and "eat the frog" method

#### 4. Productivity Predictions
- **Best Focus Times**: Analyzes historical data to suggest optimal focus periods
- **Optimal Task Count**: Recommends manageable daily task numbers
- **Break Durations**: Suggests rest periods based on work intensity

## ðŸ’¬ AI Chat Interface (`src/components/AIChat.jsx`)

### Features
- **Real-time Chat**: Interactive conversation with AI productivity coach
- **Context Awareness**: Provides advice based on user's current data
- **Smart Responses**: Recognizes keywords and provides relevant advice

- **AI**: "Pick your top 3 priorities for today. Use the '2-minute rule'..."

## ðŸ“Š AI Insights Dashboard (`src/components/AIInsights.jsx`)

### Components
1. **Productivity Score**: Visual circular progress indicator (0-100)
2. **Smart Insights**: Color-coded insights with priority levels
3. **Personalized Recommendations**: Actionable advice with action buttons
4. **AI Predictions**: Grid of productivity predictions and tips

### Visual Elements

- **Color Coding**: Different colors for different insight types
- **Priority Badges**: High/Medium/Low priority indicators
- **Interactive Elements**: Clickable recommendations and refresh button

## ðŸ”§ How to Extend the AI Features

### 1. Add New AI Analysis Types

```javascript
// In aiService.js, add new analysis logic
if (userData.newMetric < threshold) {
  insights.push({
    type: 'warning',
    title: 'New Metric Alert',
    message: 'Your new metric is below optimal levels.',
    suggestion: 'Try this specific improvement technique.',
    priority: 'medium'
  })
}
```

### 2. Expand AI Chat Responses

```javascript
// In AIChat.jsx, add new keyword patterns
if (lowerMessage.includes('newtopic')) {
  response = "Here's specific advice for the new topic..."
}
```

### 3. Add New AI Components

```javascript
// Create new AI-powered components
const NewAIComponent = () => {
  const { state } = useApp()
  const aiData = aiService.analyzeUserData(state)
  
  return (
    <div className="card">
      <h3>New AI Feature</h3>
      {/* Your AI component content */}
    </div>
  )
}
```

### 4. Integrate External AI APIs

```javascript
// Example: OpenAI integration
const generateAIResponse = async (userMessage) => {
  try {
    const response = await fetch('/api/ai', {
      method: 'POST',
      headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
      body: JSON.stringify({ message: userMessage, userData })
    })
    const aiResponse = await response.json()
    return aiResponse.message
  } catch (error) {
    return "I'm having trouble connecting right now. Try again later."
  }
}
```
